# âš¡ Simple-Lightning-Template
This is a basic and simple template for PyTorch projects that utilizes PyTorch Lightning and Weight and Biases (Wandb).
The goal of this project is to streamline the process of creating PyTorch projects from scratch or adapting existing 
ones using these helpful libraries.

# How to Use this Project
1. Wrap your all your data processing step (which includes the creation of datasets, augmentations, and dataloaders) 
into a [Lightning datamodule](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/data/datamodule.html) (example provided in the 'datamodules' folder). 
2. Wrap your Torch model into a [Lightning model](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common/lightning_module.html) (example provided in the 'model' folder), more specifically :
   * Place the training/validation/test into the Lightning module using the appropriate hook and log the metrics with the logger
   * Use the configure_optimizers() hook to move Optimizers and schedulers to the Lightning model
3. Create a new config file or modify the existing 'config.yaml' to include all the hyperparameters you need inside your model and datamodule and to specify right path to your data or model checkpointing
# Note
The configuration file is currently managed using the Omegaconf package. Using Hydra, which also uses Omegaconf, would currently introduce too much 
complexity and create some frictions with other libraries and functionalities such as DDP training or W&B sweeps.

# Requirements
* Python >= 3.5
* Pytorch
* PyTorch-Lightning
* Wandb
* Omegaconf

# Features
* Easy hyperparameters management with yaml config files with Omegaconf
* Very modular code using Pytorch Lightning models and datamodules
* Native support Multi GPU, mix precision training with to Pytorch Lightning
* Clean logging of the metrics with W&B
